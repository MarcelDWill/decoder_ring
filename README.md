# decoder_ring
This project, developed during my time at Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp, involved implementing encoding and decoding functionalities using various ciphers: the Polybius square, Caesar shift, and substitution cipher. Through this project, I honed my skills in writing complex algorithms and creating comprehensive unit tests with Mocha and Chai.

The application offers users the ability to encode and decode messages using different cryptographic techniques:

    Caesar Shift: This cipher shifts all characters of a given message a specified number of positions to the right (if a positive shift value is provided) or to the left (if a negative shift value is provided).

    Polybius Square: Characters are translated into numeric representations based on their positions in a two-dimensional array known as the Polybius square.

    Substitution Cipher: This cipher substitutes letters in the English alphabet with different letters provided by the user, creating an encoded or decoded message.

Throughout the project, I tackled challenges in algorithm design and implementation, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the encoding and decoding processes across different ciphers. Additionally, I crafted thorough unit tests using Mocha and Chai to validate the functionality of each cipher implementation.
